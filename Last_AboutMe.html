             <p> My name is Yousef Amr Ahmed. I was born in Egypt and raised in Saudi Arabia for 10 years. After I moved to Anaheim for better schooling I finished elementary then  I moved to Fremont where I finished middle school. I now reside in Dublin and am a High school student. I play every position in soccer except for Goalie but I particularly like playing defense because it is the position where I have the most control, I am taking Computer science Principles and Spanish as my electives. I am hopeful for the future.


<br>
<br>
Some of the skills I have are communication. Communication is really important in the computer science industry as you often have to work with other people to finish a project. I am also a team player and can work well with a team to pull my wieght. I am also good at recieving feedback from others people. Recieving critisism is just as important as giving feedback. My goal is to work in the computer science industery as it is always evolving. Soon the whole world will run on code. Some of the courses I want to take are computer science and software engeneering courses.
